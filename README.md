# Test_task
To run Docker, you need to place the files I sent (excluding the README) into one directory.
Additionally, create a PostgreSQL database named Test_task with the password 4771 and the main user postgresql.
In this database, you will need to execute the queries I will attach below.
After that, go to the root folder (which should contain all the files I provided) and enter the command docker-compose up --build in the terminal.
This will open the database, and after 10 seconds, the program code will run.
Then, you need to add the queries I will provide below in the SQL database.



Since this was my first time working with Docker and I didn’t have enough time to master it, container creation might not work on your end.
If that happens, please let me know, and I’ll help fix the issue.
To check the core part of my task, you can simply run the `main.py` program and adjust the SQL table connection to fit your setup, change the links, and use the queries I provided (first, create the table, then run the Python code, and finally execute all the other SQL queries).
It was interesting for me to explore something new while completing this test task, but please, in the future, mention in the job listing that Docker skills are required, or give more time to learn it.
Once again, thank you for this task. I hope I’ll be a suitable candidate.
If any questions arise, feel free to ask, I’ll gladly answer.
